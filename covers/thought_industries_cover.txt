I have 5 years of experience working on creating, building, testing, and
monitoring Rails, Java, and Angular applications and the infrastructure that
runs them. I believe in being correct, honest, and helpful, and I love coding
because it's the closest I'm ever going to get to being a real-life wizard.

I am searching for a role where I am able to solve interesting problems through
writing code and engineering systems. I consider myself a polyglot engineer.
I know enough to be dangerous in several languages, frameworks, and systems,
and I want to expand that knowledge to truly become a guru on the subjects of
systems reliability, DevOps, and software engineering.

I love your emphasis on solid coding skills in the SRE position description.
That description fits my desired day-to-day to a T.
