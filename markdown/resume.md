## Professional Experience

Macy's Technology | 2015-Present

__Senior Developer and Operations Engineer__ | 2018-Present

_Infrastructure and Cloud DevOps_

* Utilized containers and automated tests to create Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipelines for 4
internal micro-services. The pipelines reduced the need for manual testing, completely automated artifact promotion,
and reduced production deployment time windows from hours to minutes.
* Utilized industry knowledge and current events to save Macy’s hundreds of thousands in potential license fees.  For example: alerted executives and other key stakeholders of potentially costly license change on previously free-to-use product.
* Developed Ruby library to interact with in-house certificate management API over HTTPS, which enabled configuration
management code to programmatically request, update, renew, and download SSL certificates in milliseconds.
* Mentored three new team members to develop their technical and professional skills. Two are still growing with the
team, one continued on to pursue a doctoral degree.

_In-House Operations Portal Web Application_

* Designed and led team to implement Tibco Enterprise Message Service (EMS) deployment feature, which allowed
off-shore resources to safely and confidently deploy to the EMS environments in seconds without the need for on-shore
expertise.
* Developed back-end modules to perform TCP dumps and JBoss AS recycles for in-house operations portal application,
which allowed operations and monitoring teams to collect TCP dump information, and recycle JBoss applications
simultaneously across thousands of public and private cloud virtual machines.

__Developer and Operations Engineer__ | 2016-2018

* Quickly and efficiently designed and collaboratively implemented application deployment solution for over 100 NodeJS,
JBoss AS, and Apache WS applications when business needs required a quick pivot away from expensive paid product that
would have potentially cost millions of dollars in annual licenses.
* Collaborated with various internal teams to deliver cloud-based solution to provision geographically-distributed,
load-balanced Macys.com and Bloomingdales.com sites, which enabled QA teams to test previously untestable production
scenarios.
* Collaboratively developed company standard configuration management code for over 100 NodeJS, JBoss AS, and Apache WS
applications serving Macys.com and Bloomingdales.com. Uniform infrastructure reduced feature promotion time, which
reduced time between code releases by 50% and directly increased speed-to-market by 100%.

__Junior Developer and Operations Engineer__ | 2015-2016

* Automated verification of internal firewall and routing changes using Jenkins and Ruby scripting. Saved many
engineer hours that previously were spent manually verifying changes.
* Developed, tested, and deployed automated configuration management code to configure over 400 selling and
fulfillment-critical back-end application servers. Reduced server configuration time from several hours per server to less than ten minutes.  
* Diagnosed and resolved outage on checkout-critical application in Bloomingdales.com production site during
Thanksgiving holiday 2015.

## Additional Experience

D&D Magic Item Tool
: Created a single-page web app that provides Dungeons and Dragons players and dungeon masters an intuitive application
to create home-brewed magic item cards. The front-end utilizes Angular Material to deliver a beautiful,
physical-feeling, and mobile-enabled user experience. The back-end utilizes NodeJS to deliver a responsive API even
when applying image manipulation on file sizes up to 10MB.

## Personal
I enjoy building things to solve problems whether it's creating a web app or building shelving for my garage.

I am happily married with two wonderful children.

My current reading list includes _Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship_ by Robert C. Martin.

In my free time, I dungeon master two Dungeons and Dragons campaigns for co-workers and friends located in Australia,
California, Colorado, North Carolina, and local to my home in Athens, Georgia.
